This is a simple terminal game. This project was started in 2019 by me and Wiz, but he left the programming branch. Nevertheless, it's not right for this idea to be flushed down the toilet, so it needs to be released now!

## Programming Language
Questo gioco è stato inizialmente creato con c++, perciò troverete la prima versione del gioco in questo linguaggio. Tuttavia, tramite un inaspettata piega, il gioco verrà riscritto in Java facendo anche in modo che sia compatibile per più sistemi operativi.

## Language
The trial version of the game, written in c++, is a version written in Italian. The new version that is to come out will be completely in English, so that everyone can understand what is going on inside the game. Later on maybe a multilingual version can be thought of.
